# Visualising-the-history-of-nobel-prize-winners

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the Nobel Prize data from 1901 to 2023 to uncover trends and patterns among laureates. The Nobel Prize is one of the most prestigious international awards, recognizing outstanding contributions in areas such as chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. The analysis seeks to provide insights into the demographics of winners, including gender and birth country, as well as the historical context of awards given over the decades.

## Dataset
The analysis utilizes the nobel.csv dataset, which contains comprehensive information about Nobel Prize winners. Below is a preview of the dataset's key columns:

| Column | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| id	| Unique identifier for each laureate |
| year |	Year the Nobel Prize was awarded |
| category |	Nobel Prize category (e.g., Peace, Chemistry) |
| winner |	Name of the laureate |
| gender |	Gender of the laureate (male, female) |
| birth_country |	Country of birth of the laureate |

## Objectives

Identify the most commonly awarded gender and birth country among Nobel Prize winners.
Determine which decade had the highest ratio of US-born Nobel Prize winners to total winners.
Analyze the decade and Nobel Prize category combination with the highest proportion of female laureates.
Find the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize and the category in which she won.
List individuals or organizations that have won more than one Nobel Prize throughout the years.

## Getting Started

To replicate or expand upon this analysis, clone the repository and ensure you have access to the nobel.csv dataset. Utilize data analysis libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to conduct your exploration.
